# University Project

### About:
This project was completed for the Advanced Data Management class at my university. I decided to use the DVD Database to determine the total number of rentals for each film category in each month. The pdf includes my DVD Rental Report and the dvd.sql file includes my SQL statements. I have provided links at the bottom of this page to the PostgreSQL Sample DVD Database that was used for this project.

### Project Goal: 
- The student writes complex Structured Query Language (SQL) statements for data analysis and manipulation
- The student configures data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks for automated data integration
